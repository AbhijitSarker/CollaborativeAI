# Collaborative-AI

## Description
This repository contains the source code for a web application with separate folders for the frontend (`client`) and backend (`server`) components.

## Folder Structure

### 1. Client
The `client` folder contains the React-based frontend code for the application. This includes JSX, CSS, and JavaScript files, as well as any additional assets such as images or fonts. Below is a brief overview of the main subdirectories within the `client` folder:

- **`src`**: This directory contains the React components, styles, and scripts for the frontend application.

- **`public`**: Static assets, such as images or favicon.ico, go here. This folder is served as-is and not processed by the build system.

- **`node_modules`**: This directory contains the third-party dependencies required for the frontend. It is typically generated and managed by npm.

- **`build`**: After building the frontend code, the resulting files are placed in this directory. This is the folder that is served to users when they access the application.


### 2. Server
The `server` folder contains all the backend-related code for the application, following a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. Here is a breakdown of the main subdirectories within the `server` folder:

- **`controllers`**: This directory holds the controller files responsible for handling requests, processing data, and interacting with models.

- **`models`**: Data models and database-related code are organized in this folder.

- **`config`**: Configuration files for the backend, such as database configuration or any other service configuration should be stored here, can be stored in this directory.

- **`node_modules`**: Similar to the `client` folder, this directory contains the third-party dependencies required for the backend.
